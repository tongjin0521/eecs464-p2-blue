"""
loggit.py implements a general purpose logging interface and some convenience
functions for emitting both debug and progress messages.

The interface consists of the LogWriter class and several utility functions,
most notable of which is progress().

Functions:
  dbgId, debugMsg -- used for generating useful debug messages
  
  progress -- emit a text message "immediately" as a progress indication for 
    the user. Progress messages can also be emitted using speech synthesis 
    and may be automatically logged to one or more LogWriter-s.
  
  iterlog -- iterator for log entries
  
Data Format:
  loggit logs are GNU-zipped (using the gzip module) streams of 'safe' YAML
  documents. YAML is a human and machine readable text format, much more
  friendly than XML; see http://www.yaml.org . Each document contains a single
  YAML mapping object, with at least a TIME integer and a TOPIC string. By
  virtue of the YAML standard, mapping keys are sorted in ASCII lexicographic
  order, so that if all other log entry mapping keys start with lowercase
  letters the first two keys will be TIME and TOPIC, e.g.
  
  --- {TIME: 286447, TOPIC: getter, func_name: get, value: 7}

  Concrete class LogWriter provides an interface for logging data.
  
  Logs may be written to a stream or a file. The default file format is
  a gzipped YAML file. If output is sent to a stream, the output is an
  uncompressed YAML.
  
  Each .write() operation maps into a single YAML document, allowing the
  yaml module's safe_load_all method to parse them one at a time.
  
  Typical usage:
  >>> L = LogWriter('mylog.yml.gz')
  >>> L.write( foo = 'fu', bar = 'bar' )
  >>> L.close()
  >>> for data in iterlog('mylog.yml.gz'):
