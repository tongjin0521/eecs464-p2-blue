"""
Module speak provides a simple speech synthesis interface under unix-like os-s.
It works by using the commandline program espeak.

Typical usage:
>>> from speak import say
>>> say("hello world")
>>> say("it's wonderful to have text to speech working")

If espeak is not supported, the say() function does nothing.
