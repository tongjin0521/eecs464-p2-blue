misc.py defines several useful functions that don't rightly belong in any obvious location

Functions
---------

curry -- Curry a function, returning a callable with the value of the initial parameters pre-selected. One of the mainstays of functional programming.

printExc -- Print a formatted stack-trace to standard error

loadCSV -- Load a CSV file into a list of lists

inlineCSV -- Similar to loadCSV, but takes the CSV text from a multiline python string
